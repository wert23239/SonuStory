This is my first release of this editor. There are many features
that aren't intergrated, yet.

AND: This is NOT a stable version! I don't know how many bugs there
are, but if you notice one (or more ;), write me an e-mail:

Aldoric@gmx.de


I hope it works fine for everyone :)


TIPPS:

You can change the "startposition" in the RIGHT-CLICK-MENU (in eventmode).

If you edit a tileset file (prt*.pbm in the STAGE-directory) with any
graphic application, the game maybe won't open it. To fix that problem, just
select the tileset in the "Tileset editor". The problem will be fixed then.
(That's because there must be a "(C)Pixel" signature at the end of the bitmap
file).
