<span class="small_header">Finding Where Java Is Installed</span><br />
This should be easy. First, go to the control panel and click on Java. In control panel, don't use category view - use classic view on XP, which is the same as large icon or small icon view on Windows 7.<br /><br />

<img src="img/win7_control_panel.png" title="Windows 7 Control Panel" alt="Windows 7 Control Panel" /><br /><br />

Now click on the 3rd tab that says "Java" and hit the "View" button. Look at the filepath.<br /><br />

<img src="img/win7_java_control_panel.png" title="Java Control Panel" alt="Windows 7 Java Control Panel" /><br />

In the picture, you can see that Java is installed in <span class="teletype">C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\</span><br />
If you have a 32-bit version of Windows, it's probably just <span class="teletype">C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\</span>.

<span class="small_header">Running the Assembler from a Batch File</span><br />
Normally you can just run the Doukutsu Assembler by double-clicking on it, but running it from a batch file does have some benefits. We are now going to create this batch file, which should be a lot easier than using the Command Prompt to navigate and find the Assembler.<br /><br />

Paste the following code into Notepad and save it as <span class="teletype">Run Assembler.bat</span>. The green part is important: if your Java runtime environment is installed in a different folder, then please change the filepath to that different location.

<pre>@echo off
setlocal
set path=%path%;<span class="green">C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin</span>
java -jar "Doukutsu Assembler.jar"
echo [Program Finished.]
pause
endlocal
exit</pre>

Put the <span class="teletype">Run Assembler.bat</span> file in the same folder as the Doukutsu Assembler. Double-click on the batch file and it'll run the Assembler. When you close the Assembler but not the command prompt window, you should see <span class="teletype">[Program Finished.]</span>.<br /><br />

<img src="img/cmd1.png" title="Command Prompt" alt="Command Prompt" /><br />

There are many advantages to running from a batch file. If the program unexpectedly crashes without displaying a proper error box, you can see what went wrong inside the command prompt window.<br /><br />

Also, if the program gets stuck in an infinite loop (which should hopefully never happen), you can close the command prompt window and it will shut down the Assembler immediately.<br /><br />

<span class="small_header">Using Drag and Drop</span><br />
If you want to get the Assembler to open a file by drag-and-drop, you have to edit your previous batch file:

<pre>@echo off
setlocal
set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin
java -jar "Doukutsu Assembler.jar" <span class="red">%1</span>
echo [Program Finished.]
pause
endlocal
exit</pre>

The only change we made was adding a <span class="teletype">%1</span> to the end of the 4th line.<br /><br />

<img src="img/drag_and_drop.png" title="Drag and drop" alt="Drag and drop" /><br /><br />

Now drag and drop a text file onto the batch file and the Doukutsu Assembler will automatically open the text file inside its editor.<br /><br />

<span class="small_header">Changing the Theme</span><br />
In Windows, you can easily change the theme of the assembler.<br /><br />

Go into the ProgramData folder and look for theme.ini. Open it and change the number 0 to the number 1. Save it. Now open the Doukutsu Assembler again. You will see that the appearance of the program has changed.<br /><br />

<img src="img/alt_theme.png" title="Alternate theme" alt="Alternate theme" /><br /><br />

To go back to the original theme, change the contents of theme.ini from 1 to 0.
