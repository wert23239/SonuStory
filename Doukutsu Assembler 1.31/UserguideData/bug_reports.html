With new versions come new bugs...<br /><br />

If you find software bugs in the Assembler, please report them.<br />
Even if you managed to "fix it yourself" by editing the source code,
other people probably want the same problem fixed,
so just remember to contact me.<br /><br />
To do this, drop me a PM (Private Message) or VM (Visitor Message)
on the Cave Story Tribute Site Forums. You can also try emailing me through my profile on the CS Forums,
 though beware that I do not check my email very often.

<span class="small_header">Known Bugs</span><br />
<b>The High Address Bug</b><br />
Calls and jumps cannot accept addresses higher than <span class="teletype">0x7FFFFFFF</span>, even
though OllyDbg can. This problem stems from the fact that Java cannot
really support unsigned integers. I might have to rewrite the address
management code to use long integers (8 bytes) instead of regular
integers (4 bytes). This is a low-priority bugfix because using 8-byte
integers would just slow down everything and almost nobody will jump to
an address higher than <span class="teletype">0x0500000</span> anyway.<br />
If you really want to do something like <span class="teletype">CALL ABCDEF00</span>, then there is a
way to do it. Just convert <span class="teletype">0xABCDEF00</span> into a signed negative value.<br /><br />

In 32-bit modular math:<br />
<span class="teletype">0xABCDEF00 = -1412567296 (decimal) = 0x-54321100</span>.<br />
Now use <span class="teletype">CALL -54321100</span> and you'll get the same thing.<br /><br />

This bug does not apply to regular instructions. For example, <span class="teletype">MOV ECX,90001000</span> will work fine.
<br /><br />
<b>The Line Number Bug</b><br />
Line numbers have a notorious tendency to be "off by one". Usually this is not a big deal but sometimes it can be confusing.<br /><br />
This bug might happen when you are using the up/down arrow keys to navigate a text document, or when you are pressing backspace repeatedly.<br />
This bug <i>should not</i> happen when you click the mouse on a textbox, when you are actively typing new text, or when you use Ctrl+G to jump to a line number.<br /><br />

<b>The Undo/Redo Incompatibility Bug</b><br />
If you enable syntax coloration, you cannot use Undo (Ctrl+Z) or Redo (Ctrl+Y) anymore because syntax coloration actions will mess up the stream of undoable edits. <span class="bold italics">However, if you really want to use Undo/Redo</span>, disable the syntax coloration checkbox in the Settings tab and Undo/Redo will start working again for the plain text editor.<br /><br />
This is a high priority bugfix. The ultimate goal is to get Undo/Redo to be compatible with syntax coloration so that you can still use Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y even when the code is colorized.<br /><br />

<b>The Preview Code Bug</b><br />
<del>When an error message occurs during code previews, an inaccurate line number will be given if there is a <span class="teletype">#define</span> block used in the file. This doesn't happen during one-file assemble or multiple-file assemble.</del><br />
(The Preview Code Bug has been fixed.)<br /><br />

<b>The IMUL Bug</b><br />
<del>Certain types of IMUL instructions don't work correctly. For example:<br />

<pre>IMUL EDX,EAX              ;Doesn't work! Turns into IMUL EDX.
IMUL EAX,EBX              ;Doesn't work! Backwards - turns into IMUL EBX,EAX
IMUL EAX,DWORD [464000]   ;Doesn't work! Causes error when it should be accepted.</pre>
</del>
(The IMUL Bug has been fixed.)<br /><br />
