<span class="small_header">Current Version - Java 6</span><br />
In order to run the Doukutsu Assembler, you need to make sure your computer has <b>Java version 6</b> installed.<br />
Most people already have this installed on their computers.<br /><br />

However, if you don't, use the following links:<br />
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_blank">Download Java</a><br />
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&amp;try=1" target="_blank">Check Online: Do I have the latest Java version?</a>
<br /><br />
If you don't want to "check online", you can easily check for Java by double-clicking the Doukutsu Assembler.jar file and seeing if it opens an application window.<br /><br />

Instead of <span class="teletype">*.exe</span> files, Java creates executable <span class="teletype">*.jar</span> files. You should be able to run these on any computer that has Java installed.<br /><br />

<span class="small_header">Older Versions Only - Python 2.x</span><br />
Some old versions of the Doukutsu Assembler (for example, version <span class="teletype">0.4</span>) were written in a totally different language: Python 2.x. Sorry for any horrible confusion. If you want to run these old versions of the Assembler, you need to download some kind of Python 2.x (not Python 3!).<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/" target="_blank">Download Python 2.7.2</a><br />
[Scroll down to the near-bottom. If you're using Windows, you probably want the Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.7.2)]<br /><br />

Instead of <span class="teletype">*.exe</span> files, Python creates executable <span class="teletype">*.py</span> and possibly <span class="teletype">*.pyw</span> files. You should be able to run these on any computer that has Python installed.<br /><br /><br />
