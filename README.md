## A Cavestory Mod
![Message me if you want to help.](17203779_1255465041197133_1462668901_n.png)


This is a mod for the game cavestory. Unlike most games a mod to this game is not a simple. Cavestory is small enough and simple enough there is an entire language dedicated to editing it. This editor is so small it is included in the files. 

It's called  [cave editor](http://www.cavestory.org/download/editors.php) amongst other things. This so far only uses this language and not straight assembly. But, I'm hoping to code in that soon.  



## Used Levels Include

17 Yamashita Farm (Plant) [Shadow Entrance]

30 Grasstown Hut (WeedB) [Shadow Doors]

44 Boulder Chamber (MazeS) [Shadow Doors]
